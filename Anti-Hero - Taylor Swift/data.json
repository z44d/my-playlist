  "lyrics": "[00:05.68] I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser\n[00:10.35] Midnights become my afternoons\n[00:15.14] When my depression works the graveyard shift\n[00:18.30] All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room\n[00:24.69] I should not be left to my own devices\n[00:28.02] They come with prices and vices\n[00:30.68] I end up in crises\n[00:32.45] Tale as old as time\n[00:35.02] I wake up screaming from dreaming\n[00:37.62] One day I'll watch as you're leaving\n[00:40.02] 'Cause you got tired of my scheming\n[00:42.49] For the last time\n[00:44.37] It's me\n[00:45.85] Hi!\n[00:47.14] I'm the problem, it's me\n[00:49.31] At teatime\n[00:51.95] Everybody agrees\n[00:54.90] I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\n[00:59.48] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n[01:05.26] \n[01:09.76] Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\n[01:14.78] And I'm a monster on the hill\n[01:19.64] Too big to hang out\n[01:21.09] Slowly lurching toward your favorite city\n[01:24.62] Pierced through the heart but never killed\n[01:29.45] Did you hear my covert narcissism\n[01:32.26] I disguise as altruism?\n[01:35.11] Like some kind of congressman\n[01:36.75] Tale as old as time\n[01:39.45] I wake up screaming from dreaming\n[01:41.83] One day, I'll watch as you're leaving\n[01:44.58] And life will lose all its meaning\n[01:46.94] For the last time\n[01:48.89] It's me\n[01:50.32] Hi!\n[01:51.54] I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\n[01:53.68] At teatime\n[01:56.55] Everybody agrees\n[01:59.23] I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\n[02:03.63] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n[02:09.89] \n[02:13.98] I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money\n[02:18.95] She thinks I left them in the will\n[02:24.05] The family gathers 'round and reads it\n[02:26.77] And then someone screams out\n[02:29.02] \"She's laughing up at us from hell!\"\n[02:33.41] It's me\n[02:34.81] Hi!\n[02:35.85] I'm the problem, it's me\n[02:38.26] It's me\n[02:39.72] Hi!\n[02:41.83] I'm the problem, it's me\n[02:43.53] It's me\n[02:44.71] Hi!\n[02:46.87] Everybody agrees\n[02:48.22] Everybody agrees\n[02:51.03] \n[02:53.13] It's me\n[02:54.63] Hi! (Hi!)\n[02:55.98] I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\n[02:58.05] At teatime\n[03:00.69] Everybody agrees (everybody agrees)\n[03:03.54] I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\n[03:08.09] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n[03:12.27] "
