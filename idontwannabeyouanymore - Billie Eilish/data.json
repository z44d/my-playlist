  "lyrics": "[00:17.03] Don't be that way, fall apart twice a day\n[00:25.03] I just wish you could feel what you say\n[00:34.08] Show, never tell, but I know you too well\n[00:41.86] Kinda mood that you wish you could sell\n[00:50.82] If teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled by models\n[00:58.97] Told, \"A tight dress is what makes you a whore\"\n[01:07.43] If \"I love you\" was a promise, would you break it, if you're honest?\n[01:15.96] Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before\n[01:17.15] \n[01:25.30] I don't wanna be you anymore\n[01:27.79] \n[01:42.17] Hands getting cold, losing feeling is getting old\n[01:49.93] Was I made from a broken mold?\n[01:58.86] Hurt, I can't shake, we've made every mistake\n[02:06.96] Only you know the way that I break\n[02:15.71] If teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled by models\n[02:23.99] Told, \"A tight dress is what makes you a whore\"\n[02:32.53] If \"I love you\" was a promise, would you break it, if you're honest?\n[02:40.82] Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before\n[02:49.27] I, I don't wanna be you\n[02:58.42] I don't wanna be you\n[03:06.93] I don't wanna be you anymore\n[03:17.84] "
