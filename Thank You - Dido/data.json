  "lyrics": "[00:06.25] My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\n[00:09.75] Got out of bed at all\n[00:12.38] The morning rain clouds up my window\n[00:15.52] And I can't see at all\n[00:18.12] And even if I could, it'd all be gray\n[00:21.43] But your picture on my wall\n[00:24.28] It reminds me that it's not so bad\n[00:27.43] It's not so bad\n[00:31.00] I drank too much last night, got bills to pay\n[00:34.62] My head just feels in pain\n[00:37.23] I missed the bus and there'll be hell today\n[00:40.68] I'm late for work again\n[00:43.07] And even if I'm there, they'll all imply\n[00:46.45] That I might not last the day\n[00:48.99] And then you call me and it's not so bad\n[00:52.63] It's not so bad\n[00:55.67] And I want to thank you\n[01:00.56] For giving me the best day of my life\n[01:05.75] Oh, just to be with you\n[01:11.43] Is having the best day of my life\n[01:18.15] Push the door, I'm home at last\n[01:22.14] And I'm soaking through and through\n[01:25.20] Then you handed me a towel\n[01:28.46] And all I see is you\n[01:31.07] And even if my house falls down now\n[01:34.41] I wouldn't have a clue\n[01:38.08] Because you're near me\n[01:41.55] I want to thank you\n[01:46.81] For giving me the best day of my life\n[01:52.63] Oh, just to be with you\n[01:58.31] Is having the best day of my life\n[02:04.37] I want to thank you\n[02:09.89] For giving me the best day of my life\n[02:15.90] Oh, just to be with you\n[02:21.39] Is having the best day of my life\n[02:25.69] "
