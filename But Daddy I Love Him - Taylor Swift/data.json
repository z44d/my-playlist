  "lyrics": "[00:06.37] I forget how the West was won\n[00:08.77] I forget if this was ever fun\n[00:11.45] I just learned these people only raise you to cage you\n[00:17.77] Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best\n[00:20.98] Clutching their pearls, sighing \"What a mess\"\n[00:23.68] I just learned these people try and save you\n[00:28.04] ... cause they hate you\n[00:30.83] Too high a horse\n[00:34.79] For a simple girl to rise above it\n[00:42.46] They slammed the door on my whole world\n[00:49.93] The one thing I wanted\n[00:54.08] Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned\n[00:57.52] Screaming \"But Daddy I love him!\"\n[00:59.46] I'm having his baby\n[01:02.10] No, I'm not, but you should see your faces\n[01:05.97] I'm telling him to floor it through the fences\n[01:09.03] No, I'm not coming to my senses\n[01:11.87] I know he's crazy but he's the one I want\n[01:18.06] Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid\n[01:20.62] Tendrils tucked into a woven braid\n[01:23.79] Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all\n[01:30.24] He was chaos, he was revelry\n[01:32.53] Bedroom eyes like a remedy\n[01:35.67] Soon enough the elders had convened\n[01:39.82] Down at the city hall\n[01:42.04] \"Stay away from her\"\n[01:46.85] The saboteurs protested too much\n[01:54.04] Lord knows the words we never heard\n[02:00.89] Just screeching tires and true love\n[02:05.49] And now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned\n[02:09.49] Screaming \"But Daddy I love him!\"\n[02:11.46] I'm having his baby\n[02:14.07] No, I'm not, but you should see your faces\n[02:17.64] I'm telling him to floor it through the fences\n[02:21.45] No, I'm not coming to my senses\n[02:23.64] I know he's crazy but he's the one I want\n[02:31.23] I'll tell you something right now\n[02:34.08] I'd rather burn my whole life down\n[02:36.89] Than listen to one more second of all this griping and moaning\n[02:42.00] I'll tell you something about my good name\n[02:45.65] It's mine alone to disgrace\n[02:49.10] I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing\n[02:54.78] God save the most judgmental creeps\n[02:58.27] Who say they want what's best for me\n[03:01.48] Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see\n[03:07.07] Thinking it can change the beat\n[03:10.04] Of my heart when he touches me\n[03:13.11] And counteract the chemistry\n[03:16.24] And undo the destiny\n[03:22.60] You ain't gotta pray for me\n[03:26.02] Me and my wild boy\n[03:27.93] And all this wild joy\n[03:30.65] If all you want is gray for me\n[03:34.55] \n[03:38.44] Then it's just white noise\n[03:40.12] And it's just my choice\n[03:43.67] There's a lot of people in town that I\n[03:46.28] Bestow upon my fakest smiles\n[03:49.86] Scandal does funny things to pride\n[03:52.10] But brings lovers closer\n[03:55.47] We came back when the heat died down\n[03:58.15] Went to my parents and they came around\n[04:01.28] All the wine moms are still holding out\n[04:04.25] But it's over.\n[04:07.13] Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun and\n[04:11.33] Even my daddy just loves him\n[04:13.18] I'm his lady, and oh my God\n[04:17.07] You should see your faces\n[04:19.14] Time, doesn't it give some perspective\n[04:22.47] No, you can't come to the wedding\n[04:25.06] I know he's crazy but he's the one I want\n[04:32.95] I'll tell you something right now you ain't gotta pray for me\n[04:38.50] Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy\n[04:45.06] He was chaos, he was revelry\n[04:48.61] If all you want is gray for me\n[04:51.78] Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice\n[04:56.39] \n[04:59.43] Screaming \"But Daddy I love him!\"\n[05:03.58] I'm having his baby\n[05:07.11] No, I'm not! But you â€“\n[05:10.94] Should see your faces\n[05:14.63] But oh my God you should see your faces\n[05:17.82] "
