(You've had a few?)\n[03:15.60] 'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)\n[03:18.26] Maybe I'm too busy (maybe I'm too busy)\n[03:21.33] Busy being yours to fall for somebody new\n[03:26.26] Now I've thought it through\n[03:28.62] Crawling back to you\n[03:30.75] (Do I wanna know?)\n[03:32.45] If this feeling flows both ways?\n[03:35.08] (Sad to see you go)\n[03:37.87] Was sorta hoping that you'd stay\n[03:40.86] (Baby, we both know)\n[03:43.47] That the nights were mainly made\n[03:46.36] For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day\n[03:51.82] (Do I wanna know?)\n[03:54.31] Too busy being yours to fall\n[03:57.85] (Sad to see you go)\n[04:00.14] Ever thought of calling darling?\n[04:03.88] (Do I wanna know?)\n[04:05.95] Do you want me crawling back to you?\n[04:09.55] "
