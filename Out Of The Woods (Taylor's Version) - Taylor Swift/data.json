Are we out of the woods yet?\n[00:55.51] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[00:58.18] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\n[01:00.50] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[01:03.15] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\n[01:05.75] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[01:08.45] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\n[01:11.25] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[01:16.58] Are we out of the woods?\n[01:18.82] Looking at it now\n[01:23.22] Last December (last December)\n[01:28.53] We were built to fall apart\n[01:33.08] And fall back together (back together)\n[01:37.73] Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck\n[01:41.30] The night we couldn't quite forget\n[01:43.92] When we decided, we decided\n[01:48.93] To move the furniture so we could dance\n[01:52.38] Baby, like we stood a chance\n[01:54.27] Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying\n[01:59.05] And I remember thinking\n[02:00.59] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\n[02:03.23] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[02:05.87] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\n[02:08.56] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[02:11.15] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\n[02:13.73] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (Oh-oh, oh, oh)\n[02:16.35] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\n[02:18.95] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[02:24.20] Are we out of the woods? (Yeah)\n[02:27.06] Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?\n[02:29.67] 20 stitches in a hospital room\n[02:32.11] When you started crying, baby, I did too\n[02:34.68] But when the sun came up, I was looking at you\n[02:37.36] Remember when we couldn't take the heat?\n[02:40.01] I walked out, I said, \"I'm setting you free\"\n[02:42.34] But the monsters turned out to be just trees\n[02:44.91] When the sun came up, you were looking at me\n[02:51.47] You were looking at me, oh\n[02:56.69] You were looking at me\n[02:58.29] (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)\n[03:00.69] (Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?) I remember\n[03:03.42] (Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)\n[03:06.03] (Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good) oh, I remember\n[03:08.98] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)\n[03:11.25] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[03:13.54] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (So, are we?)\n[03:16.60] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[03:18.99] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\n[03:21.52] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[03:24.08] Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)\n[03:26.65] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[03:29.32] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\n[03:32.01] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[03:34.42] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\n[03:37.39] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (do you remember?)\n[03:40.27] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\n[03:42.65] Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\n[03:44.94] Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\n[03:47.61] Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good\n[03:49.94] "
