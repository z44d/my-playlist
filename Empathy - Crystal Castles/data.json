  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPremise to interlude\nWait 'til all bones protrude\nYou're convexed, you're convert\nThere is a stain on your shirt\nSemi-sweet, semicide\nThe remorse you can't hide\nNow we molt, past our skin\nAnd make room to begin\n\n[Chorus]\nSymmetry\nYou must work in symmetry\nYou must earn their empathy\nEmpathy, empathy, empathy\nSymmetry\nYou must work in symmetry\nYou must earn their empathy\nEmpathy, empathy, empathy\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDown, down, cities fall down on me\nDown, down, cities fall down on me\nDown, down, cities fall down on me\nDown, down, cities fall down[Verse 2]\nThe final chrysalis\nSelf-controlled consciousness\nNow it feels imminent\nDone for your benefit\nEat right out of their hand\nIt's concaved all your glands\nWe're encouraged to forget\nPreference to be force fed\n\n[Chorus]\nSymmetry\nYou must work in symmetry\nYou must earn their empathy\nEmpathy, empathy, empathy\nSymmetry\nYou must work in symmetry\nYou must earn their empathy\nEmpathy, empathy, empathy\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDown, down, cities fall down on me\nDown, down, cities fall down on me\nDown, down, cities fall down on me\nDown, down, cities fall down[Outro]\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy\nYou must earn our empathy"
