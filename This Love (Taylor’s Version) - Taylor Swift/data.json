  "lyrics": "[00:01.02] We were both young when I first saw you\n[00:04.72] I close my eyes and the flashback starts\n[00:08.24] I'm standing there\n[00:11.44] On a balcony, in summer air\n[00:16.41] See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns\n[00:20.45] See you make your way through the crowd\n[00:23.79] And say \"Hello\"\n[00:27.23] Little did I know\n[00:31.76] That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles\n[00:35.46] And my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\n[00:39.19] And I was crying on the staircase\n[00:41.82] Begging you, \"Please don't go\"\n[00:46.16] And I said\n[00:47.67] \"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone\n[00:51.35] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\n[00:55.46] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\n[00:59.41] It's a love story, baby, just say yes\"\n[01:05.08] So I sneak out to the garden to see you\n[01:08.83] We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\n[01:12.20] So close your eyes\n[01:15.47] Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh\n[01:20.65] 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter\n[01:24.32] And my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\n[01:27.81] But you were everything to me\n[01:29.96] I was begging you, \"Please don't go\"\n[01:35.01] And I said\n[01:36.37] \"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\n[01:40.22] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\n[01:44.06] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\n[01:48.08] It's a love story, baby, just say yes\"\n[01:51.90] Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel\n[01:55.87] This love is difficult, but it's real\n[01:59.80] Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess\n[02:03.74] It's a love story, baby, just say yes\n[02:10.81] Oh, oh\n[02:14.70] \n[02:22.01] But I got tired of waiting\n[02:26.28] Wondering if you were ever coming around\n[02:29.91] My faith in you was fading\n[02:34.65] When I met you on the outskirts of town\n[02:37.85] And I said\n[02:39.25] \"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone\n[02:42.65] I keep waiting for you, but you never come\n[02:46.69] Is this in my head? I don't know what to think\"\n[02:50.03] He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring\n[02:54.03] And said\n[02:54.53] \"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\n[02:58.39] I love you, and that's all I really know\n[03:02.04] I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\n[03:06.40] It's a love story, baby, just say yes\"\n[03:13.23] Oh, oh\n[03:16.74] Oh, oh\n[03:21.78] 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you\n[03:26.21] "
