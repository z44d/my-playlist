  "lyrics": "[00:08.43] Do you ever feel like a plastic bag\n[00:12.45] Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?\n[00:16.16] Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin\n[00:19.99] Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?\n[00:23.99] Do you ever feel already buried deep\n[00:27.71] Six feet under? Screams, but no one seems to hear a thing\n[00:31.80] Do you know that there's still a chance for you?\n[00:35.37] 'Cause there's a spark in you\n[00:37.65] You just gotta ignite the light\n[00:42.50] And let it shine\n[00:46.20] Just own the night\n[00:49.94] Like the Fourth of July\n[00:53.20] 'Cause baby, you're a firework\n[00:57.47] Come on, show 'em what you're worth\n[01:01.29] Make 'em go, \"Aw! Aw! Aw!\"\n[01:04.67] As you shoot across the sky\n[01:09.10] Baby, you're a firework\n[01:12.75] Come on, let your colors burst\n[01:16.71] Make 'em go, \"Aw! Aw! Aw!\"\n[01:19.82] You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe\n[01:25.90] You don't have to feel like a wasted space\n[01:29.81] You're original, cannot be replaced\n[01:33.73] If you only knew what the future holds\n[01:37.31] After a hurricane comes a rainbow\n[01:41.13] Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed\n[01:45.05] So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road\n[01:49.10] Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow\n[01:52.82] And when it's time, you'll know\n[01:55.02] You just gotta ignite the light\n[01:59.85] And let it shine\n[02:03.62] Just own the night\n[02:07.36] Like the Fourth of July\n[02:10.61] 'Cause baby, you're a firework\n[02:14.79] Come on, show 'em what you're worth\n[02:18.66] Make 'em go, \"Aw! Aw! Aw!\"\n[02:22.18] As you shoot across the sky\n[02:26.39] Baby, you're a firework\n[02:30.25] Come on, let your colors burst\n[02:34.15] Make 'em go, \"Aw! Aw! Aw!\"\n[02:37.34] You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe\n[02:42.85] Boom, boom, boom\n[02:45.34] Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon\n[02:48.79] It's always been inside of you, you, you\n[02:52.84] And now it's time to let it through\n[02:57.12] 'Cause baby, you're a firework\n[03:01.28] Come on, show 'em what you're worth\n[03:05.22] Make 'em go, \"Aw! Aw! Aw!\"\n[03:08.42] As you shoot across the sky\n[03:12.85] Baby, you're a firework\n[03:16.66] Come on, let your colors burst\n[03:20.38] Make 'em go, \"Aw! Aw! Aw!\"\n[03:23.90] You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe\n[03:29.29] Boom, boom, boom\n[03:31.73] Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon\n[03:37.02] Boom, boom, boom\n[03:39.39] Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon\n[03:42.43] "
