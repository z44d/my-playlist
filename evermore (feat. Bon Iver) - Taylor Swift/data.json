December\n[01:29.70] Guess I'm feeling unmoored\n[01:34.80] \n[01:37.09] Can't remember\n[01:39.32] What I used to fight for\n[01:44.00] \n[01:46.58] I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause\n[01:51.45] On thе very moment, all was lost\n[01:56.12] Sending signals\n[01:58.61] To be double-crossed\n[02:04.02] And I was catching my breath\n[02:07.29] Barefoot in the wildest winter\n[02:09.77] Catching my death\n[02:13.75] And I couldn't be sure\n[02:17.15] I had a feeling so peculiar\n[02:21.11] That this pain would be for\n[02:24.15] Evermore\n[02:28.80] (Evermore)\n[02:32.09] \n[02:39.88] Cannot think of all the cost\n[02:43.86] And the things that will be lost\n[02:47.88] Oh, can we just get a pause?\n[02:51.74] To be certain, we'll be tall again\n[02:55.88] Whether weather be the frost\n[02:59.72] Or the violence of the dog days\n[03:03.65] I'm on waves, out being tossed\n[03:07.66] Is there a line that I could just go cross?\n[03:10.91] And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)\n[03:13.65] I thought of you\n[03:15.65] (All the things that will be lost now)\n[03:18.63] In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)\n[03:21.68] I dreamed of you\n[03:23.64] (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)\n[03:26.59] It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)\n[03:29.82] To get me through\n[03:31.54] (Or the violence of the dog days)\n[03:34.38] (Out on waves, being tossed)\n[03:35.55] (I'm on waves, out being tossed)\n[03:37.83] I swear\n[03:39.13] (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)\n[03:42.48] You were there\n[03:45.54] \n[03:59.75] And I was catching my breath\n[04:02.75] Floors of a cabin creaking under my step\n[04:09.17] And I couldn't be sure\n[04:12.22] I had a feeling so peculiar\n[04:15.91] This pain wouldn't be for\n[04:19.11] Evermore\n[04:22.54] Evermore\n[04:23.86] (Evermore)\n[04:27.22] Evermore\n[04:30.72] This pain wouldn't be for evermore\n[04:36.23] Evermore\n[04:37.01] "
