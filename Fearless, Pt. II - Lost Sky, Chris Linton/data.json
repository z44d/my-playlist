  "lyrics": "[00:09.60] Over the edge\n[00:11.77] Feel like I'm floating through the air\n[00:18.07] The pain I felt is paid for, all is said and done (oh)\n[00:26.27] I am restricted, fixed upon the web\n[00:29.97] I need to kick the habit that my mind is breathing in\n[00:34.63] Break out, I've got to see (break out, I've got to see)\n[00:39.00] Spent all my life holding all of it closely\n[00:43.63] I played it innocent, a feel of discontent\n[00:48.00] I'm finally facing it all, fearless\n[00:53.41] \n[00:59.72] Fearless\n[01:05.43] \n[01:08.33] Fearless\n[01:11.67] \n[01:17.04] Fearless\n[01:19.65] \n[01:21.75] Fearless\n[01:24.05] \n[01:26.11] Fearless\n[01:28.26] Burning the bridge that keeps us\n[01:32.18] I'm here and I'm feeling fearless\n[01:36.06] Exaggerated, that's what you assume\n[01:40.39] The story's over now, I must conclude\n[01:44.77] I am conflicted, watching where I step\n[01:48.15] Still hanging in the balance, not the life I want to live\n[01:52.58] I want to take it all, standing tall\n[01:55.64] Fear outweighed the person you are (oh-ooh)\n[02:01.82] Break out, I've got to see (break out, I've got to see)\n[02:06.22] Spent all my life holding all of it closely\n[02:11.08] I played it innocent, a feel of discontent\n[02:15.47] I'm finally facing it all, fearless\n[02:20.59] \n[02:22.74] Fearless\n[02:27.16] Fearless\n[02:31.45] Fearless\n[02:33.79] \n[02:35.84] Fearless\n[02:40.10] Fearless\n[02:44.46] Fearless\n[02:48.91] Fearless\n[02:53.17] Fearless\n[02:53.83] "
