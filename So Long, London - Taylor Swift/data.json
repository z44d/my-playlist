  "lyrics": "[00:29.70] I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist\n[00:32.86] I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift\n[00:35.83] Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away\n[00:41.26] My spine split from carrying us up the hill\n[00:44.82] Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill\n[00:48.05] I stopped trying to make him laugh\n[00:50.05] Stopped trying to drill the safe\n[00:53.78] Thinkin, how much sad did you think I had\n[00:59.17] Did you think I had in me?\n[01:03.56] Oh, the tragedy ...\n[01:06.07] So long, London\n[01:11.36] You'll find someone ...\n[01:19.32] I didn't opt in to be your odd man out\n[01:22.31] I founded the club she's heard great things about\n[01:25.35] I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath\n[01:31.24] I stopped CPR, after all it's no use\n[01:34.28] The spirit was gone, we would never come to\n[01:37.55] And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free\n[01:43.09] For so long, London\n[01:49.02] Stitches undone\n[01:55.18] Two graves, one gun\n[02:01.13] I'll find someone ...\n[02:08.78] And you say I abandoned the ship\n[02:11.05] But I was going down with it\n[02:13.84] My white knuckle dying grip\n[02:17.57] Holding tight to your quiet resentment and\n[02:20.18] My friends said it isn't right to be scared\n[02:23.46] Every day of a love affair\n[02:25.96] Every breath feels like rarest air\n[02:29.66] When you're not sure if he wants to be there\n[02:32.15] So how much sad did you think I had,\n[02:37.36] Did you think I had in me?\n[02:42.82] How much tragedy?\n[02:46.09] Just how low did you think I'd go?\n[02:50.73] Before I'd self-implode\n[02:54.05] Before I'd have to go be free\n[03:00.04] You swore that you loved me but where were the clues?\n[03:02.68] I died on the altar waiting for the proof\n[03:05.73] You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days\n[03:11.62] And I'm just getting color back into my face\n[03:17.14] I'm just mad as hell cause I loved this place\n[03:24.20] For so long, London\n[03:27.48] Had a good run\n[03:35.97] A moment of warm sun\n[03:42.72] But I'm not the one\n[03:48.33] So long, London\n[03:54.12] Stitches undone\n[03:59.81] Two graves, one gun\n[04:05.89] You'll find someone ...\n[04:11.75] "
