(Make me want you?)\n[03:21.18] Why'd you have to (why'd you have to)\n[03:23.27] Give me nothin' back?\n[03:25.22] Why'd you have to (why'd you have to)\n[03:27.43] Make me love you? (Make me love you?)\n[03:29.87] I said, \"I love you\" (I said, \"I love you\")\n[03:31.76] You say nothin' back\n[03:36.84] Why'd you have to lead me on?\n[03:39.66] Why'd you have to twist the knife?\n[03:41.81] Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'\n[03:45.76] Why'd you whisper in the dark\n[03:48.18] Just to leave me in the night?\n[03:50.67] Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'\n[03:54.36] (Say) say, \"(Don't) don't (go) go\"\n[04:00.93] I would stay forever if you (say) say, \"(Don't) don't (go) go\"\n[04:09.95] Whoa (say, say, say, say)\n[04:11.20] But you won't, but you won't, but you won't\n[04:17.79] I would stay forever if you say, \"Don't go\"\n[04:27.55] But you won't, but you won't, but you won't\n[04:32.98] "
