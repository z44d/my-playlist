  "lyrics": "[00:09.38] You went to a party, I heard from everybody\n[00:13.35] You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started\n[00:17.71] Did you get anxious, though, on the way home?\n[00:22.43] I guess I'll never, ever know\n[00:25.11] Now that we don't talk\n[00:28.90] \n[00:35.27] You grew your hair long, you got new icons\n[00:39.70] And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on\n[00:44.09] I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change\n[00:48.39] But I guess I don't have a say\n[00:51.42] Now that we don't talk\n[00:52.83] I called my mom, she said that it was for the best\n[00:57.18] Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less\n[01:01.35] I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost\n[01:07.04] And what it cost\n[01:08.80] Now that we don't talk\n[01:10.79] What do you tell your friends we\n[01:15.12] Shared dinners, long weekends with?\n[01:19.38] Truth is, I can't pretend it's\n[01:23.95] Platonic, it's just ended, so\n[01:27.72] I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (off my chest)\n[01:32.01] Remind myself the way you faded til I left ('til I left)\n[01:36.52] I cannot be your friend\n[01:38.39] So I pay the price of what I lost (what I lost)\n[01:42.07] And what it cost\n[01:43.65] Now that we don't talk\n[01:45.54] I don't have to pretend I like acid rock\n[01:49.71] Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht\n[01:54.25] With important men who think important thoughts\n[01:58.20] Guess maybe I am better off\n[02:01.28] Now that we don't talk\n[02:02.96] And the only way back to my dignity\n[02:07.28] Was to turn into a shrouded mystery\n[02:11.54] Just like I had been when you were chasing me\n[02:15.68] Guess this is how it has to be\n[02:18.62] Now that we don't talk\n[02:19.95] "
