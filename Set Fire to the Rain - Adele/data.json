  "lyrics": "[00:08.85] I let it fall, my heart\n[00:12.74] And as it fell, you rose to claim it\n[00:17.62] It was dark and I was over\n[00:21.65] Until you kissed my lips and you saved me\n[00:26.40] My hands, they were strong\n[00:30.58] But my knees were far too weak\n[00:35.46] To stand in your arms\n[00:39.58] Without falling to your feet\n[00:43.64] But there's a side to you\n[00:46.49] That I never knew, never knew\n[00:48.62] All the things you'd say\n[00:50.66] They were never true, never true\n[00:52.97] And the games you'd play\n[00:55.22] You would always win, always win\n[00:58.86] But I set fire to the rain\n[01:03.85] Watched it pour as I touched your face\n[01:08.13] Well, it burned while I cried\n[01:10.49] 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\n[01:15.05] Your name\n[01:17.69] When laying with you\n[01:21.52] I could stay there\n[01:24.04] Close my eyes, feel you here forever\n[01:30.48] You and me together, nothing is better\n[01:34.75] 'Cause there's a side to you\n[01:37.34] That I never knew, never knew\n[01:39.63] All the things you'd say\n[01:41.98] They were never true, never true\n[01:44.25] And the games you'd play\n[01:46.25] You would always win, always win\n[01:49.97] But I set fire to the rain\n[01:54.72] Watched it pour as I touched your face\n[01:59.11] Well, it burned while I cried\n[02:01.51] 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\n[02:06.44] Your name\n[02:08.26] I set fire to the rain\n[02:12.52] And I threw us into the flames\n[02:17.13] When we fell, something died\n[02:19.43] 'Cause I knew that that was the last time\n[02:23.71] The last time\n[02:26.17] Sometimes I wake up by the door\n[02:30.22] That heart you caught must be waiting for you\n[02:35.03] Even now when we're already over\n[02:39.33] I can't help myself from looking for you\n[02:43.98] I set fire to the rain\n[02:48.15] Watched it pour as I touch your face\n[02:52.79] Well, it burned while I cried\n[02:54.94] 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name\n[02:59.60] Your name\n[03:01.47] I set fire to the rain\n[03:06.18] And I threw us into the flames\n[03:10.58] When we fell, something died\n[03:12.70] 'Cause I knew that that was the last time\n[03:17.24] The last time, oh\n[03:23.87] Oh, no\n[03:28.16] Let it burn, oh-oh-oh\n[03:36.86] Let it burn\n[03:43.25] \n[03:45.91] Let it burn\n[03:52.30] "
