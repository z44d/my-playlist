  "lyrics": "[00:00.53] You had people who called you on unmarked numbers\n[00:05.54] In my peripheral vision\n[00:08.66] I let slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer\n[00:13.97] All was quickly forgiven\n[00:16.69] You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious\n[00:22.48] Flush with the currency of cool\n[00:24.72] I was always turning out my empty pockets\n[00:30.42] And when it came to yoo\n[00:32.68] I didn't come here to make friends\n[00:36.38] We were born to be suburban legends\n[00:40.41] When you hold me it holds me together\n[00:44.60] And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n[00:49.16] I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs\n[00:54.93] Would surprise the whole school\n[00:57.36] When I ended up back at our class reunion\n[01:03.12] Walking in with you\n[01:05.36] You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries\n[01:11.05] With the pages ripped out\n[01:13.58] I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium\n[01:19.17] And I can still see you now\n[01:21.36] I didn't come here to make friends\n[01:25.17] We were born to be suburban legends\n[01:29.26] When you hold me, it holds me together\n[01:33.32] And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n[01:37.81] I know that you still remember\n[01:41.35] We were born to be national treasures\n[01:45.44] When you told me we'd get back together\n[01:49.88] And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n[01:54.45] Tick tock on the clock, I pace down your block\n[01:58.69] I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\n[02:02.82] Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door\n[02:06.78] You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined\n[02:10.63] Tick tock on the clock, I pace down your block\n[02:14.88] I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\n[02:18.95] Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door\n[02:23.03] You don't knock anymore\n[02:23.57] And I always knew it\n[02:27.70] \n[02:33.47] That my life would be ruined\n[02:36.32] "
