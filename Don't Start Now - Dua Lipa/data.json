Maybe\n[00:21.06] But look at where I ended up\n[00:24.41] I'm all good, already\n[00:26.69] So moved on, it's scary\n[00:28.63] I'm not where you left me at all, so\n[00:33.43] If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody\n[00:39.37] \n[00:41.37] If you wanna believe that anything could stop me\n[00:47.72] Don't show up, don't come out\n[00:51.53] Don't start caring about me now\n[00:55.44] Walk away, you know how\n[00:59.23] Don't start caring about me now\n[01:02.69] Aren't you the guy who tried to\n[01:07.99] Hurt me with the word \"goodbye\"?\n[01:10.39] Though it took some time to survive you\n[01:15.26] I'm better on the other side\n[01:18.87] I'm all good already\n[01:20.74] So moved on, it's scary\n[01:22.74] I'm not where you left me at all, so\n[01:27.44] If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody\n[01:35.42] If you wanna believe that anything could stop me\n[01:40.67] (Don't, don't, don't)\n[01:41.98] Don't show up, don't come out\n[01:45.60] Don't start caring about me now\n[01:49.64] Walk away, you know how\n[01:53.30] Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)\n[01:59.07] Up, up\n[02:00.16] Don't come out, out, out\n[02:01.97] Don't show up, up, up\n[02:04.17] Don't start now (oh)\n[02:06.83] Up, up\n[02:08.00] Don't come out, out\n[02:09.34] I'm not where you left me at all, so\n[02:14.20] If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody\n[02:21.82] If you wanna believe that anything could stop me\n[02:28.13] Don't show up (don't show up)\n[02:30.34] Don't come out (don't come out)\n[02:32.34] Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)\n[02:36.11] Walk away (walk away)\n[02:38.36] You know how (you know how)\n[02:40.08] Don't start caring about me now (so)\n[02:45.46] Up, up\n[02:46.79] Don't come out, out, out\n[02:48.67] Don't show up, up, up\n[02:50.45] Walk away, walk away (so)\n[02:53.38] Up, up\n[02:54.34] Don't come out, out, out\n[02:56.12] Don't show up, up, up\n[02:58.22] Walk away, walk away, oh\n[02:59.72] "
