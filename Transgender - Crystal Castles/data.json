Will you ever exhume?\n[00:38.59] Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom?\n[00:42.23] Nothing can live up to promise, nothing can stop its narrative\n[00:49.17] Nothing in place of catalysts and you'll never be pure again\n[00:56.74] \n[01:27.56] Will you ever preserve? Will you ever exhume?\n[01:34.05] Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom?\n[01:38.63] Nothing can live up to promise, nothing can stop its narrative\n[01:44.75] Nothing in place of catalysts and you'll never be pure again\n[01:54.59] \n[02:23.45] Will you ever preserve? Will you ever exhume?\n[02:30.00] Will you watch petals shed from flowers in bloom?\n[02:33.66] Nothing can live up to promise, nothing can stop its narrative\n[02:40.57] Nothing in place of catalysts and you'll never be pure again\n[02:58.03] "
