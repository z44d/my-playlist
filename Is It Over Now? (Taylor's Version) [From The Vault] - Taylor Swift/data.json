  "lyrics": "[00:23.58] Once the flight had flown (ah-ha)\n[00:28.15] With the wilt of the rose (ah-ha)\n[00:32.93] I slept all alone (ah-ha)\n[00:37.73] You still wouldn't go\n[00:42.48] Let's fast-forward to 300 takeout coffees later\n[00:46.95] I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters\n[00:51.65] You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor\n[00:56.47] You search in every maiden's bed for something greater\n[01:00.42] Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?\n[01:05.92] Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\n[01:10.82] \"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out\n[01:14.94] Baby, was it over then\n[01:19.06] And is it over now?\n[01:22.08] \n[01:25.92] When you lost control (ah-ha)\n[01:30.62] Red blood, white snow (ah-ha)\n[01:35.43] Blue dress on a boat (ah-ha)\n[01:40.11] Your new girl is my clone\n[01:43.97] And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights\n[01:46.52] At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight\n[01:49.43] Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs, oh Lord\n[01:53.03] I think about jumping off of very tall somethings\n[01:57.58] Just to see you come running\n[02:00.45] And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n[02:03.89] Let's fast-forward to 300 awkward blind dates later\n[02:08.64] If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her\n[02:13.29] You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor\n[02:18.07] You search in every model's bed for something greater\n[02:22.18] Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?\n[02:27.28] Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\n[02:32.40] \"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out\n[02:36.43] Baby, was it over then\n[02:40.67] And is it over now?\n[02:44.08] \n[02:50.96] Oh, oh\n[02:56.06] Oh, oh\n[03:01.01] Think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights\n[03:03.34] At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight\n[03:06.02] Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs, oh Lord\n[03:09.97] I think about jumping off of very tall somethings\n[03:14.41] Just to see you come running (running)\n[03:17.35] And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n[03:21.38] (Flashing lights, oh, oh)\n[03:25.53] Let's fast-forward to 300 takeout coffees later\n[03:31.39] I was hoping you'd be there\n[03:33.95] And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n[03:38.86] "
